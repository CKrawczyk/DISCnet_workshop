Notes:

In the CSV files for each task, where an answer is logically inconsistent with
the question, or is not given, NaN is provided.

Each CSV consists of the following columns:
SubjectID and UnitId, answer(s) to task number.

For the click tasks, data is presented in column of [(x,y), (x,y)....], one
pair of x,y coordinates for each click answer for a given event.


note: df2 just "extracts" the annotations.
