# Good coding practices

## Overview: What problems do good coding practices solve?

Weather you are working alone or working in a team, one of the most valuable things you should keep in mind is **context transfer**.  It is not enough to just track the changes made to code, but to also track **why** those changes were made.  Many of the best practices covered within this document will be various flavors of recoding this kind of context in a way that is clear to other developers, or even to yourself when you look back at old code.

When context is well recorded it becomes easier for other develops to be on-boarded into your codebase, structural changes to the code become easier to manage, and the code becomes easier to maintain in the long run.
